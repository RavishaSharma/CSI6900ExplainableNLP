Exploring LIME and SHAP for a multiclass text classifier to predict emotions

- BaselineModel.ipynb - This file shows the text classifier that we explain using LIME and SHAP. This notebook also includes various performance metrics such as accuracy, loss and classification report.

- LIMEImplementationAndExp1 - This notebook shows the code for implementing LIME text explainer. It also includes the results of first Experiment.

- SHAPImplementationAndExp1 - This notebook shows the implementation for SHAP text explainer. It also includes the results of first Experiment for SHAP.

- Experiment2 - This notebook shows the results for the second experiment i.e 30 graphs for SHAP and LIME each. 

- dataset -> NewData.csv - The original dataset used to train and test the model 

- dataset -> Experiment2.csv - The dataset used for Expeiment 2. Contains 30 samples that were used for the experiment.
